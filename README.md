Hello lovelies! I made this pretty quickly and I'm not amazing at programming, so I hope it's not too cringe.

I made this to know how much I will have to spend on upgrade paths for Idle Home in VRChat.

This calculator simply takes the current level you're on, the level you intend to end up at, and the current price.

It then tells you how much all those upgrades will cost when you add them together.

I will continue to update it periodically with more features as I can think of plent more that this calculator could do.

Maybe I will eventually make multiple tabs with different functions to help make more efficient decisions.
